Welcome to the Cognitive-Affective Maps tools documentation!
===============================================


**CAM tools make building in-browser Cognitive-Affective Maps (CAMs) easy**. It’s a simple, graphical interace to help
setting up CAM studies using our Cognitive-Affective Map *extended logic* software. The resulting data can be analyzed
using our developed *CAM-App*.

Thank you for checking out our tools! We’ve collected a few links below to get you started, but we’re happy to help with
any additional questions or ideas you have. We’d love to hear from you! Feel free to contact us anytime.
