Welcome to the Cognitive-Affective Maps tools *CAM-App*!
======================================================

**CAM tools make building in-browser Cognitive-Affective Maps (CAMs) easy**. It’s a simple, graphical interface to help
setting up CAM studies using our *Cognitive-Affective Map extended logic* (C.A.M.E.L.) software. The resulting data can be analyzed
using our developed *CAM-App*.
