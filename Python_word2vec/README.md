Welcome to the word2vec Python Code:
===============================================

Module created by [Michael Gorki](https://github.com/mgorki)

<br>


# Overview
To run the Python source code, you have two options: **without** or **with** a *graphical user interface* (GUI):

## *Without* GUI
1. Make sure you have *python* and the libraries *spaCy* and *pandas* installed on your computer.
2. Download the file with the list of summarized words in the *Shiny App*. 
3. Install **or** download the language-model for *spaCy* you want to use if not already done before. For further information and language models and trained pipelines you can download have a look at the [*spaCy* documentation on models](https://spacy.io/models)
4. Download the python code (*word2vec.py*) (https://github.com/FennStatistics/CAMtools_CAMapp/blob/main/Python_word2vec/w2vec.py)    
5. Set the Config Variables *nlp*, *LOADFILE* and *SAVEFILE* in the python code. **Savefiles of the same name and location specified will be overwritten if not specified oterwise** 
7. Run the Python code.
8. Upload the file it created to the *Shiny App* module

## *With* GUI
1. Make sure you have *python* and the libraries *spaCy*, *pandas* and *PySimpleGUI* installed on your computer.
2. Download the file with the list of summarized words in the *Shiny App*. 
3. Make sure you have a *spaCy* language-model-pipeline for the language you want to use saved on your machine. For language models and trained pipelines you can download have a look at the *spaCy* documentation on [models](https://spacy.io/models), for information on how to save them on your machine have a look at the *spaCy* documentation on [saving and loading](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading)   
4. Download the python code [*word2vecGUI.py*](https://github.com/FennStatistics/CAMtools_CAMapp/blob/main/Python_word2vec/w2vecGUI.py) and [*GUI.py*](https://github.com/FennStatistics/CAMtools_CAMapp/blob/main/Python_word2vec/GUI.py) and save them in the same folder.
5. Run *word2vecGUI.py*.
6. Follow the instructions that are showing up on your screen in the GUI.
7. Upload the file you just created to the *Shiny App* module.


# Details and ressources
1. How to install libraries for python: https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html
2. How to run a python (.py) file once you have installed python and libraries for python (there are more ways) on [www.pythonbasics.org](https://pythonbasics.org/execute-python-scripts/) 
3. The module for downloading the list of summarized words in the *Shiny App* is part of the preprocessing part and is named "apply word2vec model".
